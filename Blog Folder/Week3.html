                    <em>What I want the user to see and do:</em><br/>
                    I want the user to “play around” on the website. In the sense that I want to user to be engaged and have fun with particularly the various interface elements 
                    that allow for engaging user interaction. I want to user to spend time experimenting with the interface elements.
                    I want the user to feel at ease while using the website even as they have fun – I want it to be a relaxing and refreshing experience.
                    I want the user to explore my portfolio and engage with and give feedback to my Essays, Blogs and projects.</p>

                    Software developer employers who are looking for someone who is willing to take on challenges and experiment with unconventional and creative interface elements.

                    <p><em>My content (what is interesting and important):</em><br/>
                    My portfolio (my work and skills), Blogs (my process through this fluctuating journey of creating my first official html website), Essays (my objective analysis 
                    and personal opinions on the topics given) and profile (to get to know me) is majority of the content. The most important being my portfolio as it will reflect my 
                    skills, my capabilities, and interests.</p>
