                    <P>
                    I had assistance in setting up the GitHub and VS Code as I had missed 2 weeks of class. However, it was  
                    fairly a straight-forward and it was done in less than 10 minutes. Navigating VS Code is also mostly 
                    straight-forward, however, it is a bit more complicated to push to changes to my repository as opposed 
                    to using the GitHub application which I am more familiar with.</P>

                <td><h3>Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today</h3> 
                    
                    <p>The 1945 paper “As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush, is an interesting collection of Bush’s thoughts and predictions regarding the future of technology and science. Reading it in 2024, leaves goosebumps because of how surprisingly accurate most of his 
                    predictions are simply because he made predictions based on his observations and information at the time and it is even more interesting to see how his hypothetical suggestions and ideas have influenced the technological industry today. 

                    A notable hypothetical idea was what Bush named “memex”. He describes memex as an electronic device for individual use that stores compressed files and thus can store a library of information – from books, to records, to communications. </p>
                    
                   <p> Bush drew inspiration from the human mind and the way it works. He noted that the mind “operates by association”, such that when the mind thinks of one thing, it will find something else that is associated with it thus creating an “association of thoughts”. 
                    The mind therefore has an “intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain” – the mind is a network of information and while the information is not permanent, the speed at which information is processed and moved around in the mind is something that is very difficult 
                    to replicate (in other words information in the nervous system moves at extremely high speeds), and thus Bush marvelled at the greatness of nature. Bush makes it clear that though it is impossible to replicate what is natural, it is possible to learn from it (this is also called biomimicry 
                    in the scientific field), hence his suggestion of “memex”. </p>
                    
                    <p>Bush further describes that a trail can be made and kept permanently (unlike the human mind which doesn’t store information permanently) on the memex. This “trail” is meant to mimic the “association of thoughts” in the human mind that Bush talks about earlier on. The trail is made when the user joins 
                    two items together by pressing a certain key and then when the user needs to call the data of one of these items, the user can do so by tapping buttons and using numbers as code. In this way, multiple items can be joined together hence it forms a trail – to go back in the trail, the user uses a lever to go 
                    back like turning the page of a book. The user therefore “builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him”.</p>
                    
                    <p>This idea of “trails” contributed to and inspired early hypertext systems, and therefore the world wide web that we all use today. When we visit websites today, we can access specific information of that website, by being redirected to different links that exist within that website – like going from the “homepage” 
                    of a website to the “contacts” page – it is also possible today to simply go back to the original page we were previously on (by simply clicking the “back” button) because that page has been stored permanently. 
                    
                    Memex today has even been coined as a name for the program “DARPA Memex Program” which was inspired by the idea of the memex to combat human trafficking on the web by using AI search technologies. 
                    
                    It is incredibly interesting that just from observing human nature and making a hypothesis based off what one knows, something like the Internet could be formed today.</p>

                <p>
                    <li>The first node-to-node communication was done in 1969, with one computer in Standford and another in UCLA. The word “LOGIN” was to be transmitted from one computer to the other, however, the message crashed and only the words “LO” was transmitted.</li>
                    <li>Computers used to be as big as a house up until the late 1900s. In just a few decades however, computers now are small enough to fit into our hands, and some can even be fit into a small backpack. The rapid development of technology is not only inspiring but also almost scary. </li>
                    <li>The first spam email was sent in 1978, because someone sent emails to ARPANET users to try to sell them computers.</li>
                    <li>The first item sold over the internet was marijuana – the deal was made online, but the people met in person. In 1994 however, the first actual online transaction took place when a man by the name of Dan Kohn sold his CD.</li>
