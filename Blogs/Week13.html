                    <h2>Reading reflection: The internet as a moral space: the legacy of Roger Silverstone Shani Orgad</h2>
                
                        <p>These are some points that stood out to me:</p>

                    <h3 class="h3">
                        Proper Distance and responsibility:
                    </h3>
                        <p> 
                            <li>
                                Communication over the internet requires the understanding of the other person on the other side of the device and thus establishes a proper distance between the two parties. A distance such that one is always respectful of boundaries, yet is never harsh or cold. 
                            </li>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>
                                As a web developer, perfecting that proper distance is dependent on my understanding of my responsibilities. According to this reading, when one understands the meaning of “unconditional responsibility” one can establish proper relations. It means to always hold your weight, regardless of it being reciprocated. To make it more specific, Silverstone referred to the “welcoming” of the other into one’s space. A s a web developer, there is a moral responsibility in how we welcome users to our websites and apps. 
                            </li>
                        </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">
                        Networking, sociability:
                    </h3>
                        <p> 
                            <li>
                                In communicating online with others, there is a sense of sociability created. The way these social interactions contrast face-to-face communication must be considered. In creating a website, the way certain things are communicated face-to-face, can sometimes change in the way it is communicated to the user over the internet.  </li>
                            
                        </p>
    
                    <h3 class="h3">
                        Anonymity and online intimacy:
                    </h3>
                        <p> 
                            <li>
                                Anonymity online has done this strange thing of creating a sense of intimacy online – unlike the intimacy in person – because in some ways, it is easy to share what can not be shared in person. However, in many ways, Silverston argues, it is not to be confused with responsibility. Just because it seems easy to switch off from the internet, does not mean it is actually possible (as humans we are hardwired in a sense to not be able to switch on and off so easily). In some ways it is easy to evade responsibility hiding behind the mask of anonymity and it is easy for humans to avoid moral obligation when we think we can just turn off the device and go back to living life. As a web developer, in designing webpages, even though it is possible to foster intimacy with the user on the other end, there is still a moral obligation on my end to not cross boundaries or fall into fostering a dark pattern out of the perceived closeness with the user. </li>
                            
                        </p>
                   
                    <h3 class="h3">Closing Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>
                        To maintain a space on the internet that aligns with the general ethics agreed upon, and that aligns with my own personal morals, a lot of careful consideration into every step of coding and designing is needed. Studying and taking the time to listen to various kinds of people, can also help mitigate the chance of losing sight of my responsibilities as well as helping to mitigate exploitation (intentional or unintentional) of users online. </p>
                    <p>
                        Something that is interesting however, is how web developers or software developers are seemingly a people that are very asocial, however to be a good web developer a deep understanding of people is actually needed. Otherwise how else does one uphold their moral obligations and responsibilities? It is not only about getting the work done and accomplishing what you want to accomplish, it is also about how, as a human, does one contribute to the overall wellbeing and preservation of society and people.
