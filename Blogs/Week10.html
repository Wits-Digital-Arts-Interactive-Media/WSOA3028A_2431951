                        <p>In the reading chosen, digital inequality is looked at on three tiers. The first level relating to access to the internet, the second level relating to the skills needed to operate such technologies, and the third level relating to the gain (positive and negative) from the use of the internet and such technologies. 

                    </p>

                    
                        <p> Access to the internet is the most basic of the digital divides. It is noted that there is a divide in traditional access to the internet, mobile access to the internet and access via new AI technologies. Traditional access refers to access via computers and devices that are generally immobile/less mobile, mobile access refers to access by means of a mobile phone or any portable device (with a small screen), and access by AI technologies refers to access by devices such as smart speakers and robots in the home. Against these three types of technologies, we can observe certain inequalities in access to the internet. 
                        
                    </p>

                    
                        <p> Mobile devices are useful, such that they are convenient and cheaper for individuals to purchase especially in low-income countries, however there are limitations that come with mobile devices that limit an individual’s range of access to the internet. For example, mobile devices have small screens and thus to type documents on a phone is not productive compared to typing on a PC. There is also a limited access to content on a mobile device – older websites often did account for mobile access and do not render content well, thus, making it difficult for users to navigate and access content (especially content of official government websites, Home Affairs being a great example of this). In addition, mobile devices generally do not have the hardware and software capabilities for users to easily modify certain programs – an aspiring coder, for example, must have full access to a non-mobile/traditional device, a mobile device simply will not do. 

                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AI powered technology is the new buzz. However, the advancements made in AI powered technologies restrict certain functionalities further than mobile and non-mobile devices despite the many advantages it seemingly comes with. AI comes with the obvious advantage in that it has a lot of potential in aiding individuals that have disabilities thus making such devices very good in bridging certain inequalities. However, AI powered devices are limited in the content they source from – it is a still limited pool, AI would have to advance further in order to pool from more sources of information. Such devices are also limited in their software and hardware modifications since they often come from a very concentrated market.

                    <p>
                        In the next tier the inequalities in skills needed to be able to interact with, understand, and communicate with the internet and technological devices, is addressed. It is not good enough if individuals have access but no skills to understand how to make use of the thing, they have access to. It is observed that age is especially a deciding factor in this tier. It was found that young, educated men are often the users that across the board understand how to use the internet. Young people often make fun of older generations not being “tech savvy” however, it is ironically a satirical commentary on the digital divide on the basis of age and educational level.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the last tier, the digital divide in the gain from internet use is discussed. There is beneficial gain and harmful gain from using the internet. For example, some users may profit (beneficial towards the individual) in a disproportionate amount to others (harmful to others) thus enlarging some socio-economic gaps further – such as the Winkelvoss brothers who, despite being already economically privileged, became the first billionaires in cryptocurrency. Furthermore, there is also research on the risks of internet use from a privacy and social-wellbeing perspective particularly on children and uneducated users. Users that are often underprivileged (socially, and economically), often are not educated on the risks that come with internet and social media use, thus putting them at greater risk of internet scams, fraud, and predators online in addition to the fact that they also the users most often surveyed and tracked (by governments and other organizations) without their informed consent since surveillance technology has advanced a lot recently.
