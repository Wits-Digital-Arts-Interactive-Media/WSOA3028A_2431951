                        </h3>

                <div class="item">

                        <p>I chose to critically engage with three articles, that speak to the need for digital access across the globe given the 2020 COVID-19 Global pandemic. The pandemic of 2020 brought to light a lot of the issues prevalent in our world today pertaining to access to the internet. Given the nature of the pandemic and the need for a complete lockdown, many individuals had to migrate from working on site to working remotely – including students. Unfortunately, few people tend to thrive in such an economical and social shift – a lot of jobs require on-site interaction to be effective, working remotely therefore is a huge economical setback for many businesses and individuals. 

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>It was estimated by UNESCO, that 50% of the 1.5 billion students working remotely did not have computer access and 40% did not have internet access at all. The greater concern is the disparity across different parts of the world. In low-income countries, the divide between those that have access and those that don’t is greater. In Sub-Saharan regions, 82% of students had no access to the web. By 2020, it was clear how much of a reliance our greater society had on the web and on digital devices thus those with limited to no access at all are left at multiple disadvantages.
                        
                        </p>

                    
              
                        <p> The most obvious one being lack of access to the developing economic market in which those that have access to the web are able to “sell” their work and skills. We are living in a fast-growing global market with demanding digital skills and knowledge – things are different, what is demanded by employers and companies has changed from what it was a decade ago. The digital sphere in the last decade has made leaps and bounds in sophistication and advanced capabilities thus not having access to this rapidly moving industry sets individuals 100 steps back in comparison with their peers who do have access. This economical set back contributes to more individuals and thus whole communities, being thrust under the poverty belt. If one can no longer sell their skills in this new market, then how is one supposed to sustain themself?  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is no surprise therefore, that countries and societies that are commonly referred to as “low-income” or “developing” also have the major setback of a majority of their citizens lacking access to the web. How are “developing” countries supposed to compete with their technologically advanced counterparts in the global north (both eastern and western countries can be considered part of the global north) when (on top of other civil issues hindering their economic growth), they have the least access to the markets and industries controlled by these counterparts?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another obvious disadvantage is the lack of access to information and knowledge and by association lack of access to quality education that is supposed to equip the youth. As expressed before the COVID-19 pandemic caused 1.5 billion students to study from home as lockdown restrictions restricted a majority of their access to on-campus interaction. Speaking from experience, online schooling was a nightmare in some ways and a door to innovation in other ways. As a student in my final year in high school, that had access to the web, a computer, and a workspace at home, I still found myself struggling in so many ways to adapt to the online learning environment. Now if I, a privileged student with such access struggled in some ways, how much more did students that don’t have access at all to the three things I listed, struggled? The disruption of the pandemic to educational institutions and students therefore has forced these institutions to restructure and rethink their methods of education and educational access and on a broader scale has caused us all to think more critically about the need for technological and internet access for all groups of people. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Technological access should no longer be thought of as a luxury that few can afford, but rather as a basic need for all people around the globe. Our youth especially in low-income countries can not progress unless the need for technological and internet access is addressed on a broader scale (not only in private institutions but public institutions too).
