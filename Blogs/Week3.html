                    <h4>&gt;&gt; What I want the user to see and do:</h4>
                    <p> I want the user to “play around” on the website. In the sense that I want to user to be engaged and have fun with particularly the various interface elements 
                    that allow for engaging user interaction. I want to user to spend time experimenting with the interface elements.
                    I want the user to feel at ease while using the website even as they have fun – I want it to be a relaxing and refreshing experience.
                    I want the user to explore my portfolio and engage with and give feedback to my Essays, Blogs and projects.</p>

                    <p>Software developer employers who are looking for someone who is willing to take on challenges and experiment with unconventional and creative interface elements.
                    The average user who just wants to have a “fun” time playing around with my website.</p>

                    <h4>&gt;&gt; My content (what is interesting and important):</h4>
                    <p>My portfolio (my work and skills), Blogs (my process through this fluctuating journey of creating my first official html website), Essays (my objective analysis 
                    and personal opinions on the topics given) and profile (to get to know me) is majority of the content. The most important being my portfolio as it will reflect my 
                    skills, my capabilities, and interests.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Interface Elements</h3>

                    <li>Ability to move some images around the website</li>
                    <li>Private notes area for the user to make notes as they read the essays. Or potentially introducing a comment section for users to engage amongst each other?</li>

                    <h2>Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme and how it relates to semantic markup.</h2>
                    <p>
                        The exercise above helped me revisit my folder structure and URL scheme which also in turn relates to the semantic markup. By clearly defining the user alignment, 
                        I was able to see how, through interface elements, I can direct my users to view the information I want them to see but also helped me to realize that through my folder structure and URL scheme, 
                        content should be easily accessible in order for users to have a pleasant experience. If my folder structure and URL scheme is simple and straightforward, so will the user experience be satisfying. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Semantic markup is a part of creating this user experience because semantic markup is about how the HTML elements are used appropriately for their intending purpose to express the interface elements 
                        accordingly. By embedding tags correctly and using the appropriate tags, the browser will convey to user my designs as I intend and therefore the user can respond and interact appropriately without getting confused.
                        For example, I will try avoiding 'div' and 'span' tags as a means of separating content on the page because they do not convey much meaning, and I will instead opt for 'article' and 'section' tags to section parts of my page. 

                    </p>

                    <h2>Reflect on your development progress for the week.</h2>
                        <p>
                            In all seriousness, not much progress was made this week, as I was still trying to catch up week 2 work – particularly the reading for week 2 took me some time to process and understand in order to comprehend properly.
