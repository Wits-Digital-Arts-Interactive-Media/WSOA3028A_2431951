                    <h2>Javascript Reflection:</h2>

                         <p> I started working on the Card Flip mechanic which at first seemed like a daunting task however with a bit of research and debugging it is looking hopeful. The card flip mechanic especially on the sections within the blog posts go well with the “Playground” theme of the website. In terms of interaction design, it invites the user to (like the draggable elements) feel in control since they can decided to view the information or not by a click of a button that reveals the blog post content. The hardest part of this mechanic is getting it to work for multiple elements, and essentially modifying the code to be scalable for future use. </p>

                    
                        <p> I do need to, however, redo my wireframes for the essays especially since the card flip mechanic does not really suit it.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection: The Road to Technocolonialism</h2>
                    <p>
                        This reading was very interesting, and I personally feel that the subject matter discussed in this reading is not spoken about enough. Not enough people are concerned about what is happening currently. </p>
                
                    <p>
                        The article highlights two major influences of AI technology on a state’s power – on the economy of a country, and on the military. The superpowers of nearly every war in human history all had great economy and a strong military force. AI elevates what this means for the superpowers in the world today. In the military, advancements in cyber-operations and powerful weaponry have been made simply because of the integration of Artificial Intelligence. In the economy, superpowers are able to advance productivity and thus propel their economies because of AI. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today these two superpowers are the US and China, specifically. The US’s involvement in the middle East with AI driven weaponry is the most obvious, along with the some of the biggest technological companies coming from the US (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Apple). In China, companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, Temu, Xiaomi have dominated the markets as well. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most interesting thing however, is their increased interest and involvement in developing countries following their advancements. There is an incentive for American and Chinese companies to invest in invest their technologies in developing countries and there is an incentive for developing countries to comply. In exchange for economic advancement and to avoid being left behind in the rapidly growing economy, developing countries have already started linking arms with these tech companies, however, there is a cost. Automation completely obliterates not only what is traditionally seen as unskilled labour, but even some skilled labour is going out of fashion. Autonomy is also one of the major things developing countries are exchanging with these superpowers. These superpowers now have access to the data of all the citizens of that specific developing country – an obvious security risk and open door to exploitation. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Africa specifically, the fact that Google and Facebook dominate 82% of the “digital advertising industry” in Africa and the fact that 4G and 5G networks in Africa are largely controlled by Huawei (Huawei constitutes 70% of Africa’s 4G infrastructure) is a glaringly obvious sign of techno-colonialism on the rise. It is like the cold war all over again with Africa and other developing countries, being the ping-pong ball and experiment (business as usual).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        African leaders and African citizens alike, need to pay more attention to what is happening. Our data is the new diamond and gold that these superpowers are fighting over. If we fail to pay attention and do something about it, we will be fighting for independence once again. Same script, different movie. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Personal experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Between 2019 and 2020, Former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to block Huawei from trading with US tech companies and sourcing from them. This was partly done in an attempt to address national security risks. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As seen in the quote below from the reading
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="h-cite" cite="https://gizmodo.com/trump-extends-executive-order-banning-huawei-from-using-1843461208">
                        “The biggest effect of the ban on Huawei is that while it can continue to use Android in its phones—because Android is a free and open-source operating system—Huawei lost access to Google Mobile Services, which includes a number of major Google apps and features. Huawei can’t put Google Maps, YouTube, or the Google Play Store (among other popular Google apps) on any of its devices.” </blockquote>


                    <p>
                        The ban had negative effects for many people around the world using Huawei devices with American software and applications. I for one, have a Huawei phone. Before the ban, I could access all google services on my Huawei. However, after the ban, I could no longer access any google services. In order to do so, 3rd party apps must be downloaded (an obvious security risk for the individual), and even with those 3rd party apps, to this day, using google services is tricky – some apps work, some don’t depending on the day. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, most applications are available on the istore or google play, however, few apps are available on other platforms like the Huawei store and thus, for me to get access to some applications on my phone, I have to download APK versions of everything – a long winded process that I have to bet on because the APK versions do not always work and the version of apps available on the Huawei store always glitch on my phone. As an African, this neo-technological cold war between the US and China has direct impact on what information I can access and not access.
