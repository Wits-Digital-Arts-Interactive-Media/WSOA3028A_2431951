                <p>When analysing the ethics of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) practice, there are various things to consider. To be a designer is to create what others will use. In web design specifically, without the user, the website is rendered useless. It is thus natural for a web designer to ask the question “How can I communicate to the user my intentions?”. The “How” part is important because it is impossible to answer it without understanding that it depends on “ethics”. Ethics are a professionally shared set of values within an industry, and thus within the web design industry, it helps web designers navigate the “how” in manner that is not only legal but moral because designers are humans first [1] – or in the wise words of the musician RM in the song Yun, “I wanna be a human 'fore I do some art”.</p>
                <p>
                    Before a web designer even considers the industry’s general shared set of standards and values, the designer must ask themself, “What are my values?” and “What motivates me” [1]. It is important because when you hold to a certain set of morals, it shows up naturally in your day-to-day work [1]. Upon asking myself this, I came up with what can be summarized as “serving others”, and “honesty is the best policy”. I am therefore motivated in designing websites that are transparent, and websites that give the user as much control as possible. In the industry, there are a few that stood out to me, namely: accessibility, user control and consent, informative interface feedback, and avoid dark patterns. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To elaborate, accessibility refers to how users with various cognitive and physical abilities, and socio-economic circumstances can interact with the interface [2]. Accessibility is important because, various people will be interested with the product or service being sold or provided, and thus it is appropriate to design an interface that caters to all people within the audience that is being targeted. It is suggested therefore to every designer that accessibility be at the forefront not in the afterthought in the design process [4].

                </p>
                <p>
                    Good and informative interface feedback refers to how the interface responds to an action [3]. Unless the interface responds appropriately and correctly to the user’s action, the user is not able to navigate the website with clarity. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly avoiding dark patterns should be at the forefront of every designer’s mind [6]. To create an ethical environment for the user to navigate, the products designed should not harm the user [5]. Dark patterns are recurring aspects in a design that manipulate the user’s actions [3] psychologically, and as soon as the user is being manipulated, transparency is lost, and the user no longer has the control. Dark patterns are not accounted for enough by designers. In a study about dark patterns, 240 apps were surveyed and according to the results, 37% of the apps had 3-6 dark patterns and 47% contained 7+ dark patterns [6]. Clearly within the industry of web design, dark patterns are unfortunately common. Dark patterns are divided into the following broad categories: nagging, sneaking, interface interferences, obstruction and forced actions [6].
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website chosen to unpack and analyse ethics in UI/UX further is the Dischem online store website [7]. Dischem is a retail pharmacy company in South Africa. In analysing this website with regards to its application of ethical UI/UX practice, I looked at what is considered bad practice and good practice against the standards laid out and described above. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to accessibility, an example of good practice is as follows. Upon landing on the home page of the website, it is worth noting that the font type and font sizing align with ethical practices. The font type is Montserrat which is a widely used font type in websites, and it is known for its legibility [8]. The font size for headings and important information is also appropriate – it is large and often in bold and capitalized. In the context of readability, the text is left-aligned; the eye of the average user reads text from left to right, the text in sections is spaced out such that headings and general text are not sitting atop one another; everything is spaced out evenly making it easy to read the descriptions of the products, the names of the products, the pricing etc. In addition to this, for users that are on the colour-blind spectrum, certain information on the website such as a price change because of a discount, are written in red with the old price crossed out but still visible so the user can judge for themselves whether the discount is reasonable, and they can compare the two prices. This shade of red has a striking contrast to the greyscale text and so even if the user can not differentiate between all the colours on the page, there is still a contrast in the tone of the colour and the text is also compensated for by size and boldness. 
                </p>
                <!--figure 1 & 2 goes here!-->

                <figure>
                    <img src="../WebsitePictures/Fig1.png" alt="Fig1" width="400" height="320">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1: Price of discounted kettle in colour</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../WebsitePictures/Fig2.png" alt="Fig2" width="400" height="320">
                    <figcaption>Figure 2: Price of discounted Kettle in black and white</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Another example of good practice is in how the three-click rule is mostly adhered to. Just from the beauty homepage, the user can get to the 4th subpage in the hierarchy directly simply because the navigation area is detailed and has hyperlinks to various subpages laid out in an organized manner. Even from the homepage user can navigate easily to other sub-subpages. In making the navigation clear and detailed, it makes accessing products on the website easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the context of user control and informed consent, there are examples of ethical and non-ethical practice. In good practice the user is given the liberty to create as many shopping lists as they require. This allows the customer to customize the online shopping experience and it helps the user organize the products they want to buy instead of just adding everything directly to the cart (even though this is also an option should the user want to purchase a few items quickly).
                </p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="../WebsitePictures/Fig3.png" alt="Fig3" width="400" height="320">
                    <figcaption>Figure 3: Navigation Hierarchy</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../WebsitePictures/Fig4.png" alt="Fig4" width="400" height="320">
                    <figcaption>Figure 4: Shopping lists</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    In bad practice, however, regarding the user’s privacy, the website does not make enough effort to inform the user of the privacy policy in a clear manner. Upon entering the website, in a small text area and the bottom of the page a “cookies” notification pops up. However, the notification only tells the user that cookies are being used and gives no other explanation as to how and if the user has control over the way these cookies are used. The only way the user can find out more, is by clicking the hyperlink that redirects the user to separate page that highlights the privacy policy of the company in detail. However, the user is more likely to click on the “x” button and is less likely to be bothered to read up more on the privacy policy if it requires the extra step of being redirected to another page. If the user wants to revisit this privacy policy, the only way to do so is to scroll to the bottom of the page and under the “Legal” section, in small sized text the hyperlink to the page is available. This can be seen as bad practice because the website is not transparent and obvious enough with the user regarding their privacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon analysing the effectiveness of the feedback as a user adds a product to either a shopping list or the shopping cart, the user is given confirmation that they added the specific product to their list by means of a pop up on the side of the screen saying, “X has been added to Y list”. This pop is in green text (which stands out), and the text area is big enough to be noticed by the user from the corner of their eye. This notification helps the user understand clearly that the task of adding to the list was carried out and if the user did not intend to add the product to the list, the user rectify their mistake immediately. In addition to this, the interface also confirms to the user visually, in the top-right corner of the screen near the shopping cart, there is a number that indicates the quantity in a bright red circle. This is ethical implementation of informative interface feedback. 
                </p>

                    <img src="../WebsitePictures/Fig6.png" alt="Fig6" width="400" height="320">
                    <figcaption>Figure 6: Notification that item is added</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The last thing analysed was dark patterns on the website. Although in some ways the website tried to avoid some dark patterns – that are common on other retail websites – there were still a few dark patterns that crept up that could not be avoided. It can be observed that a lot of online stores tend to include “suggestions” of related products as the user is adding a specific item to their cart. This can be considered nagging, because as the user is deciding to buy an item, there are more products being suggested to them, potentially encouraging the user to subtly buy more. This website however, in the section where the user adds the product to their cart, there are no extra suggestions being made to them by the algorithm, instead only the description and key information of the product itself are displayed. Another common dark pattern on online stores is the encouragement of infinite scrolling. However, on the Dischem website, a maximum of 35 products are displayed at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having said this, the dark patterns that were not avoided were largely under “Interface interference” and “Nagging”. The most obvious interface interference occurs at the start of opening the homepage of the website. A live countdown for the launch of new product with a “learn more” button popped up and filled most of the screen. This countdown is an example of subtle emotional manipulation. The “Learn More” button was black with white text which stands out in the white background. Additionally, there was a large picture next to the text depicting the product to be launched visually. The Exit button was also grey with white background therefore it can take a bit longer for the user to locate it, and thus those extra seconds it takes for the user to exit, the user is coerced to read and consider buying the product. Another interface interference is the layout and way the text to notify user that prices might differ online as opposed to in-store is displayed. The text size is small and although bold it is at the very bottom of the page that the user would have to scroll down. The interface interference in this sense also contributes to the dark pattern of sneaking because an important term is somewhat hidden from the user. 
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../WebsitePictures/Fig7.png" alt="Fig7" width="400" height="320">
                    <figcaption>Figure 7: Quantity of items in shopping cart</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../WebsitePictures/Fig8.png" alt="Fig8" width="400" height="320">
                    <figcaption>Figure 8: Countdown for launch of Dove Skincare</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The last dark pattern under the category of nagging, is debatable. On each landing page, products that are discounted or on sale or trending are suggested first and take up a large portion of these pages. Unless the user knows exactly what they need to be able to navigate to what they want, and unless the user sees the navigation panel first, the user can get distracted and is somewhat tempted to buy the products that are on sale and trending, even if the user has no need for these products, the user is tempted towards participating in consumerism. There is even a “Feel Good Finds” products section on each landing page. This can be considered nagging because the user can get distracted easily from the task they are currently doing [6]; however, it is not a consistent nag as it only occurs on landing pages of each major category on the website. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, in analysing the Dischem website, one can observe the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of one of the biggest pharmacy retail stores in the country with regards to their application of ethical UI/UX practice. Thus, serving as opportunity for South African web designers to learn and grow in their craft as designers.
