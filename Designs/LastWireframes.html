                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>The goal for this website is promote and encourage user control and interactivity. The name of the website is "Playground" and thus
                    to stay true to this, I aim to give the user a truly "playful" and "enjoyable" experience by introducing them to interactive elements, 
                    and giving meaningful feedback.

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">HOMEPAGE: </h3>
                <figure><img src="../WebsitePictures/homepage_last.png" alt="Homepage Wireframe" width="85%" height="85%"/></figure>
                <P>
                    The homepage is simple and only contains 4 main components: 
                    <li>The main navigation area which contains the links to the main pages of the website. It is situated at the top in large writing for each of access.</li>
                    <li>A text area for introductory text that has a "typing animation" to welcome the user to the website.</li> 
                    <li>A group of draggable letter elements that are randomly spawned in the middle area. Users upon visiting the website interact immediately giving them a sense of control and to pique their curiosity.</li>
                    <li>A footer area that contains my primary socials.</li>  </P>
            
                <h3 class="h3">Navigation Homepages: </h3>
                <figure><img src="../WebsitePictures/page_last.png" alt="Navigation Wireframe" width="85%" height="85%"/></figure>
                <p>
                    All navigation pages have the same layout. The only difference is the colour scheme (further explained in the style guide). Tha website title is 
                    situated in the top left corner, the main navigation in the top right corner. Together these two elements form the header. </p>
                <p> Below the header, large text with "typing animation" display the heading of the homepage that the user is on. </p>
                <p>Below the heading, a short summary of that specific group of pages is given, to give the user context into what the subpages will be about.</p>
                <p>Below the summary, a secondary navigation to specfic subpages is displayed vertically in large boxes. Each "box" has the date the page was posted, a heading, a short summary of the page,
                    and a "Read More" button. User's can decide which posts they want to read based off the date, title and summaries.
                </p>
                <p>At the bottom of the page, there is a footer - the same as the one on the homepage</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Navigation Subpages: </h3>
                <figure><img src="../WebsitePictures/subpage_last.png" alt="Designs Navigation Wireframe" width="85%" height="85%"/></figure>
                <p>Each subpage - similar to the homepages - has the same layout with different colours. At the top the header is situated.</p>
                <p>On the right, the secondary navigation to the other subpages is hidden initially to not disturb the user, but it is visisble when the user presses the button that says "Other..."
                    The button is always visible to the user no matter how far they have scrolled down for ease of access and convience should the user wish to navigate to a different post quickly.
                </p>
                <p>On the left, there is a button to take the user back to the specfic homepage should the user wish to.</p>
                <p>Below this button is the title of the post in big bold letters. Below the title is the author and date of the post, and below that is the content of the post itself.</p>
                <p>At the bottom of the page, there is a scroll up button should the user wish to go back to the top of the page, and below this button is the footer.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Portfolio Page: </h3>
                <figure><img src="../WebsitePictures/portfolio_last.png" alt="Essay Navigation Wireframe" width="85%" height="85%"/></figure>
                <p>The portfolio page uses the old idea of the infinte horizontal scroll that was initially for the specific homepages.</p>
                <p>There is a heading, and a short description of the portfolio projects</p>
                <p>Underneath this description is a row of buttons that give the user the option to filter the projects by multiple groups. The user can easily find the projects there are interested in.</p>
                <p>Each project in the horizontal scroll has an image, title with hyperlink to the respective project, and a text summary of the project. And underneath, the footer is displayed at the bottom of the page. </p>
            
                <h3 class="h3">Profile Page: </h3>
                <figure><img src="../WebsitePictures/profile_last.png" alt="Portfolio Navigation Wireframe" width="85%" height="85%"/></figure>
                <p>The profile page is similar to the old wireframe. Each grouping of information is displayed as a draggable box that the user can interact with, similar to the letters on the homepage.
                    The profile page is more casual than other parts of website hence the interactable objects. The addition however, is in the implementation of the flip cards that was originally for 
                    the blog posts. The flip card function is more appropriate in this section. And so each box is draggable and flippable.
                </p>
                <p>Another interactable addition is the implementation of a random fact generator on one of the cards.The user can have fun reading interesting facts about me.</p>

                <h2>Information Structure</h2>
                <p>The final information structure and hierarchy of the website is as shown in the image below</p>
                    
                    <figure><img src="../WebsitePictures/inforstructure_last.png" alt="Info structure" width="85%" height="85%"></figure>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3">Homepage:</h3>
                    
                    <p>The user is met first with the homepage.From here the user can navigate to the blogs, essays, profile, or portfolio. In the footer, the user can also navigate to various socials, and can directly send an email should they wish to. </p>
                    
                    
                    <h3 class="h3">Navigation pages:</h3>
                    
                    <p>The user can navigate from the homepage, to various navigation pages namely, the blog nav page, the essay nav page, and the designs nav page. 
                    All these nav pages have the same layout with the same interface elements to keep the website consistent and uniform.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3 class="h3">Subpages:</h3>
                    
                    <p>The user can navigate from the nav pages to the various subpages. The interface elements across the subpages are the same.
                    The subpages also allow the user to navigate to other main pages, the homepage of that subpage, and other subpages (within the same navigation category).</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3 class="h3">Profile:</h3>
                    
                    <p>The profile is the only page that has slightly different interface elements. I reintroduced the draggable elements and made it central 
                    to how the user interacts with the page. I also used the "flip card" function here as described earlier.</p>
                    
                   
                    <h3 class="h3">Portfolio:</h3 >
                    
                    <p>The user can navigate to the specfic locations where the respective projects are uploaded by hovering over the title of the project. The user can also navigate to other pages by the main navigation.</p>

                <p>The User Flow is fairly similar to the first two iterations such that the 3-click rule is generally adhered to. However, there are no Portfolio Subpages, instead the user is taken directly to the repos or website in which the projects are uploaded on. In addition, the user can navigate directly to the social links provided in the footer which was not in the original user flow. </p>

                            <p>On the blogs, essays, and designs homepages, the navigation for those posts are placed in containers for easy display. On the portfolio page, each project is summarized with a link in a card-like format as well.</p>

                            <p>In one of the blog posts, a table is used for comparision of information found from research. In this way the user can easily compare and contrast the information.</p>

                            <p>The custom cursor is not only for visual aesthetic, but the size of the custom cursor was increased, to make navigating the website easier and more accessible. This goes hand-in-hand with the 
                                in-built pointer and grab cursor when the user drags elements of clicks specific elements.

                <h2>Style Guide</h2>
                    <h3 class="h3">Colours</h3>
                        <figure><img src="../WebsitePictures/colourpallette.png" alt="Profile  Wireframe" width="85%" height="85%"/></figure>
                        <p>The colour palette was inspired by common colours found on actual playgrounds [1]. To truly make it a playful experence, 
                            I experimented with bold colours (colours of the rainbow), and used them strategically in such a way to bring life and excitement to
                            the website, without overwhelming the user. Therefore the bold colours were balanced with the azure blue and the black. The Azure blue was used instead of plain white
                            simply because white was too contrasting, the azure blue was a more cool toned colour that contrasts with the black, yet it is not overwhleming on the eyes. Even the shade of black used was toned down slightly to be easier on the eyes.
                            Each colour (red, orange, blue, green, pink, purple) was used in a different section of the website. The colours were used only for highlights,headings, nav componenets, buttons, and links in the footer. In this way the colours were used in parts of the 
                            website that were most important, or parts that i needed to stand out. I tried to also spread the positioning of the colours across the page to have some balance.
                            Most of the text is black, for ease of reading, except for areas where an element was highlighted and thus the colour changed with the hover effect.
                        </p>

                        <p><li>The user is greeted with green, because green on playgrounds is a grounding colour and brings tranquility. As the user enters the website they are greeted with an inviting colour.</li></p>

                        <p><li>Pink is used for the profile page because it is described as a youthful and sweet colour in addition to the fact that it is my favourite colour. This colour showcases my personality the most.</li></p>

                        <p><li>Purple is a more mature, elegant colour, hence why it was used to showcase my portfolio projects.</li></p>

                        <p><li>The orange, blue and red colours on the other pages do not have as in-depth meaning, however, orange and red are particularly passionate colours hence appropriate for my blog posts and essays since they reflect my thoughts. The designs are in blue because the designs are 
                            reflective of a more analytical thought process and thus the colour blue generally invokes a more neutral, calm emotions than the other colours.</li>
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="h3">Fonts and Text</h3>
                        <p>The fonts used are derived from the "Lucida Console", "Courier New" font family. The Lucida Console is an evenly spaced font type, and similarly, the "Courier New" is commonly used in code and programming environments.
                            These fonts are therefore legible, clean looking fonts that make reading easy and comfortable. Part of creating an enjoyable user experience is ensuring that users can comfortably digest the information fed to them.
                        </p>

                        <p>The space between the lines are also slightly larger than the standard line-spacing. This makes reading easier for users that have cognitive limitations.</p>

                        <p>The sizing of the headings on the various pages was intentional. The headings are purposefully in large text around the website for legibility purposes.</p>

                    <H3 class="h3">Styling of Elements</H3>
                        <p>Most elements on the website have rounded edges because as breifly mentioned in previous iterations, the website is meant to be more playful than serious, and thus, the rounded borders are more friendly and less serious.</p>
                        <p>Some elements when hovered upon enlarge and/or change colours, this is for user responsiveness to make the user experience more enjoyable.</p>
